# Werewolves-Game

## Werewolves Game(Like Mafia but Asian version)

## The best game to play during quarantine!

## Project description

Quarantine time has made many people crazy =)
The best way to destress is to play games and interact with other humans. This game is designed to be highly interactive and maybe for some their first time hearing a person’s voice in the summer!

We’ll be going into business as a board game company. Users can log in to the game page and join different groups to play a round or multiple rounds of the game werewolves.

The game is essentially like Mafia where:
The objective:
For the werewolves to kill the civilians
Or the civilians to find all the werewolves and vote them out of the game
Instruction:
Players are given different roles and with the different roles they have different abilities( So randomized for the web app)
There will be a host that keep track of Character’s and ensure turns for each player
Countdown timer for people to choose who to kill and next item
Game ends when an objective is reached. Either werewolves win or civilians win.

Potential Prototype: This might be made as an app or a web app. Up for discussion in pros and cons

## Team
I'm looking for one to two other people to join the team. (Zhi-hao and Jordi have agreed to join)

## SQL

There will be thee database tables
User Login Info
Character Info
Updated Game Info

## No-SQL 

Leaning towards using a column family database. But, not exactly sure specifics.

## Business 

This will be a two tiered business. 

At no charge, anyone may use the service to play the game, however the number of users and character roles are limited. Amount of time spent on the game is also limited.

We will invite people to pay or donation for the service if they wish either 
To have unlimited playtime
More users and characters allowed

We plan to have a prototype that works in git pages and then expand when we have enough sponsors and funding.

## Legal 

The business will be a Taiwan LLC. 

## Technical 

Our priorities will be: 
1. Choose an initial SQL database for a github page
2. Choose both client-side and server-side programming languages
3. Choose appropriate framework for our client
